## Description
This was our final project for the Full Stack Web Development Program through the University of Washington. This application allows users to SignUp using Firebase Authentication and Firestore to store all the user data. After signing up, users can then proceed to login into their account and search for a movie of their choice. A list of movie will be generate for users to browse through and click on a movie. This will then open a popup page with more information on the movie. Users then have the ability to rate, comment or save the movie to the database.

## Contributing
This application is open for contribution. If you have any addition, correction or updates you would like to see please reach out to me through GitHub or Email. We can work together to improve and add to the application build.
## Test
We manually tested the project on our own. There were no test designed for this project. We would eventually design some test in the future for the application.
   - Go to https://picaflic.herokuapp.com/
   - Search for any movie
   - Rate, comment and save movie to the database
These were the manual functions we used to test the functionality of the application.
## Challenges
   1. The first challenge was the fact that it was a group project and everyone had different schedules that we have to navigate.
   2. The delegation of tasks was difficult because we wanted to ensure that everyone had an even amount of task distributed amongst the group
   3. Working with React and understanding the life cycle and heirachy of the different components and events was a challenge
   4. We used a technologies that was new to us called Firebase and Firestore. That took most of the time to figure out, we used it for the login and signup function. Making sure a user is created in the database and ensuring everything work correctly was frustrating but worth the time that we spent on it. Overall, this part of the build was very informative and eye opening for us.
   5. Saving data to the firebase was a challenge but after som time of researching we were eventually able to get it to do what we wanted.
   6. This was the most challenging build of all the projects that we had to do in the BootCamp. We combined all of the technologies and tools we had learned throughout the program. The project was worth it and there is so much potential to it and we have big plans to expand on the build for future aspirations.
We have future aspiration of where we want the application to go.
   1. Create Library component for the users to be able to view all their saved movies
   2. Create more of a profile page, so users can see the movies they have already searched and saved. This will also give them more of a control on the content and account accountability.
   3. Bring in another API that will allow them to be able to view trailers for the movies
   4. Add a function for them to be able to buy, rent or watch free movies
These are just some of the future plans we have for this build. We will continue to update and add more functions to the application for a better user experience.
